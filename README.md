# README

This is everything that I learned about front end programming from one semester at a University. I'm not trying to embarrass the school or the teacher who taught the class. All that I am trying to do is demonstrate the difference there is between what I learned from traditional schooling and the bootcamp that I attended at Bottega in Lehi Utah. For the record, the school did not teach me how to put this file onto a website, Bottega did.

The school that I attended taught me many things that Bottega didn't teach me.  They taught me the theory of programming. How to make classes, polymorphism, search algorithms.

Bottega taught me how to make something useful. If you look at my GitHub account, there are many projects that I have made from said school, but none of which I can show you like the ones from Bottega. Not to say that I don't value this said school. I plan to graduate with a bachelors degree from there. This just goes to show that somethings have to be learned away from traditional schooling.
